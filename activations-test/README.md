Akamai have the ability to allow the same configuration to be deployed to our staging network and/or production. This workflow does not seem to be easy to model in Terraform. So this example breaks the relationship between an activation and a property so that modification of the property does not automatically push it to any network. To push, you need to run "terraform apply" in the staging or prod directory.
