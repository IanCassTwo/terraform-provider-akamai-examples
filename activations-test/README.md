Akamai have the ability to allow the same configuration to be deployed to our staging network and/or production. This workflow does not seem to be easy to model in Terraform. So this example breaks the relationship between an activation and a property so that modification of the property does not automatically push it to any network. To push, you need to run "terraform apply" in the staging or prod directory. One could also take this idea and make it so that a staging push happens automatically when a config is updated but the production push needs a separate step.
