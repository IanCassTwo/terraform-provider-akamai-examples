This example is using a variable in the activation resource to define which network to push the config to (staging, production). Note, Terraform considers the activation to be an individual managed entity so if you change from staging to production (or vice-versa), Terraform will assume you want to move the resource. This will result in a destroy followed up a create. This is almost certainly not what you want to do!
